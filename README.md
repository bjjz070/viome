# Viome Review: Personalized Gut Health Testing That Actually Tells You *What to Eat* — Not Just What's Wrong

---

I've been poking around the gut health space for a while now, and here's the thing — most microbiome tests give you a fancy report full of bacteria names you can't pronounce, and then basically shrug. "Good luck figuring out what to do with this." Viome takes a different approach. Instead of just cataloging what's living in your gut, it tries to tell you exactly what to eat, what to avoid, and which supplements might actually move the needle for *your* body. Whether that's worth the price tag is a conversation we need to have.

So let's get into it.

## What Is Viome, Actually?

Viome is a personalized health company founded in 2016 by Naveen Jain out of Bellevue, Washington. The company raised over $175 million in its first two years, receiving support from investors like Khosla Ventures and Bold Capital. The core idea is straightforward: send in a sample (or a few), let their lab crunch the data, and get back a personalized roadmap for your health.

What separates Viome from the pack is *how* they test. Viome offers an at-home RNA gut and health test that measures users' microbial, human, and mitochondrial gene expressions to offer personalized food and supplement recommendations. That's RNA sequencing, not DNA. Unlike many other services that rely on DNA — which is unchangeable — Viome looks at mRNA, which is constantly changing, and provides a snapshot of your current health status. That's actually a meaningful difference — it catches what's happening *right now* in your gut, not just what you were born with.

The company has tested over one million microbiomes at this point, and the company has partnered with esteemed institutions like the Mayo Clinic. Their lab is CLIA-certified, which is the same standard clinical labs in hospitals have to meet.

## How the Tests Actually Work

There are a few different tests depending on how deep you want to go. The simplest one just needs a stool sample. The most comprehensive one asks for blood, saliva, and stool — which sounds intimidating until you actually do it, and then it's... fine, honestly.

The sample collection has to be done first thing in the morning — even before brushing your teeth. For the stool part, Viome includes a collection paper that's flushable (a small but genuinely thoughtful detail). Blood collection uses a simple finger-prick lancet and small vials. Saliva is just spit into a tube. The kit comes with clear step-by-step instructions and prepaid return labels.

After receiving your sample(s) and questionnaire, it takes 2-3 weeks for health scores and recommendations. Some reviewers have reported getting results faster than expected — one tester got theirs back in about a week.

Once results are in, everything lives in the Viome app. Viome's app was well-designed, displaying "Good," "Average" and "Not Optimal" Scores for each metric. It also includes videos and articles providing extra information about the recommendations.

## What You Actually Get Back

This is where Viome starts to stand out a bit.

The **Gut Intelligence Test** gives you 20+ health scores and a personalized food list. The results are both fascinating and actionable. For instance, one of our testers discovered that — among other foods — bell peppers could be problematic in his diet. A couple of easy clicks within Viome's interface revealed that his gut microbiome contained the pepper mild mottle virus, which studies show can cause gut inflammation. That kind of specific, *why*-driven insight is rare.

The **Full Body Intelligence Test** cranks it up to 50+ health scores. Receive over 50 precision health scores, including your biological age (BioAge), gut and oral microbiome status, cognitive and metabolic functioning, immune system response, and more. You also get insights into how your body reacts to 370+ foods.

Viome's Health Intelligence Test takes it even further, detailing things like biological age and the health of your stress response, immune system, and more. The company's most comprehensive screening, the Full Body Intelligence Test, adds cardiometabolic health and even cognitive wellness to the picture.

One thing that genuinely impressed reviewers: Viome's results pages are incredibly thorough. They offer deep and valuable insights that you can address on your own or — more preferably — with your doctor.

## The Cancer Detection Test (Yes, Really)

This one deserves its own section because it's genuinely different from anything else on the consumer market.

Viome Discovery CancerDetect for Oral and Throat Cancer is the first test of its kind to serve as an early detection system for oral and throat cancers that usually don't get attention until they've progressed to a dangerous stage. All it requires is a simple saliva sample.

CancerDetect brings unprecedented accuracy to early cancer detection and prevention as the only oral and throat cancer test to offer detection with 95% specificity and 90% sensitivity. The test has received FDA Breakthrough Device Designation for accelerated review due to its potential transformative impact on early cancer detection.

This test detects molecular features associated with Oral Cancer (Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma or OSCC), and/or Throat Cancer (Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma or OPSCC) in saliva samples. It's not FDA-approved as a diagnostic tool yet — they're working on that — but the breakthrough designation is a serious signal.

## What Real Users Are Saying

The reviews are genuinely mixed — which, honestly, is more trustworthy than five stars across the board.

On the positive side, one verified reviewer shared: "Love the customize supplements and especially the toothpaste. The past two times I have been to the dentists after using the Viome customized toothpaste, my doctor's reaction was: 'I have never seen...'" Another noted that Viome's gut intelligence test has been a huge help for recent gut issues, with dramatic improvement seen within days of following recommendations after months of problems.

Another user reported weight loss and positive changes in skin from following the company's personalized plan, writing that they were down 20 pounds since switching to their recommended foods, with more energy and clearer thinking.

On the other hand, common complaints include delivery delays, unclear reports, and high supplement prices. Some users have pointed out that there are limited explanations as to why you should favor or avoid a particular food. While there are insights, they are often vague.

Viome's app has over 100,000 downloads on Google Play with an average rating of 3.5 stars. Many users praise the personalized insights and have noticed improvements in digestion and energy.

The expert consensus is generally more favorable. Viome's most comprehensive test (Full Body Intelligence Test) is the one that provides the most valuable, actionable insights. Innerbody Research, which spent over 450 hours testing Viome and its competitors, gave it a 4.75 out of 5 rating.

## Is Viome Worth It? The Honest Take

Here's the deal. Viome is not cheap. The Full Body Intelligence Kit costs $399, and the recommended supplements cost an additional $199 per month, with a required four-month commitment. If you go all-in on the subscription route, you're looking at a real financial commitment.

But what you *are* getting is genuinely different from most competitors. Viome uses the most advanced sequencing currently available, with results bolstered by the only advanced AI system in the field. With more than 200 potential ingredients at the company's disposal, it's the only one to do so with such a high level of accuracy and comprehensiveness.

Viome separates any identifiable information from your health data. All data is protected with multiple layers of encryption to ensure its security. Viome also commits never to sell your data and won't provide your information to employers, health insurance companies, or law enforcement. Privacy-wise, that's solid.

**Who should consider Viome:**
- You're dealing with persistent gut issues and standard advice isn't cutting it
- You're health-conscious and want data-driven, personalized nutrition guidance
- You're a biohacker type who wants the most comprehensive at-home testing available
- You're in a risk group for oral/throat cancer and want proactive screening

**Who might want to think twice:**
- Budget is a real concern — the subscription model adds up fast
- You're looking for a one-and-done diagnostic (Viome works best as an ongoing system)
- You want FDA-approved diagnostic certainty (these are wellness insights, not medical diagnoses)
